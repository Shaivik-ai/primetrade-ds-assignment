# **Data Science Assignment: Trader Sentiment Analysis**

This project is a submission for the Data Science Internship at Primetrade.ai.

Candidate: Shaivik Shende  
Date: 24-10-25

## **Project Objective**

The goal of this analysis is to explore the relationship between cryptocurrency trader behavior and overall market sentiment, as defined by the "Fear & Greed Index."

The analysis seeks to answer questions such as:

* How do trading metrics (PnL, leverage, volume) differ between "Fear" and "Greed" market periods?  
* Can we identify traders who consistently perform well (or poorly) in specific sentiment regimes?  
* What correlations exist between sentiment and trading outcomes?

## Note on Large Data Files

The `merged_data.csv` file generated by the notebook is over 25 MB and is therefore not included in this GitHub repository, per standard Git practice for large generated data.

The file can be fully reproduced by:
1.  Downloading the two original datasets from the links provided in the assignment.
2.  Running the `notebook_1.ipynb` (also available on Google Colab).

## **Methodology**

1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the two provided datasets: Historical Trader Data.csv and Fear & Greed Index.csv.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   * Converted the trader data's time (nanoseconds) into a standard datetime object.  
   * Created a normalized Date column in the trader data.  
   * Converted the sentiment data's Date column into a datetime object.  
   * Merged the two datasets on this common Date column.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   * Grouped the merged data by sentiment Classification (Fear/Greed).  
   * Analyzed key metrics: average PnL, total PnL, average leverage, and trade count.  
   * Grouped data by individual account and Classification to rank traders.  
4. **Visualization:** Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations for the final report.

## **Key Findings**

*\[Briefly summarize your 2-3 most important findings here. This should match your ds\_report.pdf.\]*

* **Finding 1:** \[Example: While overall PnL was higher during "Greed", the median PnL per trade was slightly negative, suggesting many small losses. "Fear" periods showed higher PnL volatility.\]  
* **Finding 3:** \[Example: A list of top 5 "contrarian" traders was identified who generated over 70% of their total profit during "Fear" markets. (See report for details)\]
